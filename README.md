# KA-CHOW : Accurate Architectural Modeling of a Photonic SmartNiC Accelerator

This is the final project for the class [6.5930] Hardware Architecture for Deep Learning of Christos Zarkos, Nikita Lazarev, and Victor Ion Butoi.

To recreate the results of this work, you can simply run the [lightning\_guide.ipynb](https://github.com/czarkos/ka-chow/blob/main/workspace/models/arch/1_macro/lightning_sigc_2023/lightning_guide.ipynb) notebook which is located at `workspace/models/arch/1_macro/lightning_sigc_2023` within the repo.

This projects is based on CiMLoop (Andrulis et al., ISPASS  2024), employing the same repository design and reusing much of the code from their publicly available github repo: https://github.com/mit-emze/cimloop/tree/main.
